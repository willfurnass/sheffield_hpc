DL_POLY_CLASSIC is a general purpose classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulation software developed at Daresbury Laboratory by I.T. Todorov and W. Smith.

Usage
-----

DL_POLY_CLASSIC 1.9 can be activated using the module file::

    module load apps/dl_poly_classic/1.9/gcc-6.2-openmpi-2.1.1
	
The DL_POLY_CLASSIC executable is ``DLPOLY.X``. Three DL_POLY input files ``CONFIG``, ``CONTROL`` and ``FIELD`` are required in the directory where you run your job.

Batch usage
-----------

Users are encouraged to write their own batch submission scripts. The following is an example batch submission script, ``my_job.sh``, to run ``DLPOLY.Z`` and which is submitted to the queue by typing ``qsub my_job.sh``. ::

    #!/bin/bash
    #$ -cwd
    #$ -l h_rt=00:30:00
    #$ -l rmem=2G
    #$ -pe mpi 8

    module load apps/dl_poly_classic/1.9/gcc-6.2-openmpi-2.1.1
    
    mpirun DLPOLY.X

The script requests 8 cores using the MPI parallel environment ``mpi`` with a runtime of 30 mins and 2 GB of real memory per core.
*Note:* If your ``OUTPUT`` file appears truncated when running a DL_POLY job using MPI, then add the ``l_scr`` keyword to your ``CONTROL`` file to place the output in the standard output file (see section 5.2.5 Parallel I/O in the user manual).

Installation notes
------------------

DL_POLY_CLASSIC 1.9 was compiled from source using the -O3 Fortran compiler options. 

During compilation DL_POLY_CLASSIC has been optionally interfaced with the PLUMED 2.3.2 library.

The installation of DL_POLY_CLASSIC was tested using TEST01 for DL_POLY_CLASSIC (See https://ccpforge.cse.rl.ac.uk/gf/download/frsrelease/145/8489/TEST1.tar.gz for details).
