Advanced Job Submission Methods
-------------------------------

In this section, the concept of each advanced submission method will be described with 
subsequent explanations of how to implement these on each scheduler.

Job or task arrays
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An "array job" is a set of tasks run from a single batch job submission script. Each of these tasks should consume a relatively large amount of 
compute time to maintain optimum efficiency.  If each task is short (seconds or even a few minutes),  array jobs will saturate the scheduler 
and more time is spent managing jobs than running your jobs. This will also negatively impacts other users!

**Advantages of array jobs:**

* You only need to submit one job to run a series of very similar tasks;
* These tasks are independent and do not all need to run at once so
  the job scheduler can efficiently run one or more queued tasks as the requested computational resources become available;
* They are particularly useful for `Embarrassingly Parallel <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embarrassingly_parallel>`_ problems such as:

  * Monte Carlo simulations;
  * Parameter sensitivity analysis;
  * Batch file processing.

**Disadvantages of array jobs:**

* If a single task fails to run correctly it can be a pain to determine and re-submit failed tasks.
* If the tasks are small, the scheduler will spend more time managing and queueing your tasks than computing them.

.. warning::

  Array jobs on Bessemer and Stanage can have a maximum of 1000 tasks.

SLURM job arrays are only supported for batch jobs and the array index values are specified using 
the ``--array`` or ``-a`` option of the sbatch command as follows: 

.. code-block:: console

  # Submit a job array with index values between 0 and 31
  $ sbatch --array=0-31

  # Submit a job array with index values of 1, 3, 5 and 7
  $ sbatch --array=1,3,5,7

  # Submit a job array with index values between 1 and 7
  # with a step size of 2 (i.e. 1, 3, 5 and 7)
  $ sbatch --array=1-7:2

Job arrays will have two additional environment variable set. ``SLURM_ARRAY_JOB_ID`` 
will be set to the first job ID of the array. ``SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID`` will be set to the job array 
index value. ``SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_COUNT`` will be set to the number of tasks in the job array. 
``SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_MAX`` will be set to the highest job array index value. 
``SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_MIN`` will be set to the lowest job array index value. 

For example a job submission of this sort:

.. code-block:: console

  $ sbatch --array=1-3
  Submitted batch job 39319

Will generate a job array containing three jobs with the environment variables set as follows:

.. code-block:: shell

  SLURM_JOB_ID=39319
  SLURM_ARRAY_JOB_ID=39319
  SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID=3
  SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_COUNT=3
  SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_MAX=3
  SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_MIN=1

  SLURM_JOB_ID=39320
  SLURM_ARRAY_JOB_ID=39319
  SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID=1
  SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_COUNT=3
  SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_MAX=3
  SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_MIN=1

  SLURM_JOB_ID=39321
  SLURM_ARRAY_JOB_ID=39319
  SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID=2
  SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_COUNT=3
  SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_MAX=3
  SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_MIN=1

All SLURM commands and APIs recognize the ``SLURM_JOB_ID`` value. Most commands also recognize the ``SLURM_ARRAY_JOB_ID`` 
plus ``SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID`` values separated by an underscore as identifying an element of a job array. Using the 
example above, "39320" or "39319_1" would be equivalent ways to identify the second array element of job 39319 as 
shown in the following ``sacct`` command example. 

.. code-block:: console
  :emphasize-lines: 1,7
   
   $ sacct -j 39319_1
   JobID           JobName  Partition    Account  AllocCPUS      State ExitCode
   ------------ ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- --------
   39319_1      array.sh  sheffield       free          1  COMPLETED      0:0
   39319_1.b+      array                  free          1  COMPLETED      0:0
   
   $ sacct -j 39320
   JobID           JobName  Partition    Account  AllocCPUS      State ExitCode
   ------------ ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- --------
   39319_1      array.sh  sheffield       free          1  COMPLETED      0:0
   39319_1.b+      array                  free          1  COMPLETED      0:0

Note that the parent job runs the final task. In the following ``sacct`` command example using
``SLURM_ARRAY_JOB_ID`` (39319 i.e spawning job) will retrieve details of the whole task array:   

.. code-block:: console
  :emphasize-lines: 1
   
   $ sacct -j 39319
   JobID           JobName  Partition    Account  AllocCPUS      State ExitCode
   ------------ ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- --------
   39319_1      array.sh  sheffield       free          1  COMPLETED      0:0
   39319_1.b+      array                  free          1  COMPLETED      0:0
   39319_2      array.sh  sheffield       free          1  COMPLETED      0:0
   39319_2.b+      array                  free          1  COMPLETED      0:0
   39319_3      array.sh  sheffield       free          1  COMPLETED      0:0
   39319_3.b+      array                  free          1  COMPLETED      0:0

The same output could have been achieved with ``sacct -j 39319_3`` .

**Using email notifications**

By default in SLURM, the emails for events **BEGIN**, **END** and **FAIL** apply to the job array as a whole rather 
than individual tasks. So:

.. code-block:: shell

  #SBATCH --mail-type=BEGIN,END,FAIL

Would result in one email per job, not per task. If you want per task emails, specify:

.. code-block:: shell

 #SBATCH --mail-type=BEGIN,END,FAIL,ARRAY_TASKS

Which will send emails for each task in the array. 

**Managing output and error files**

SLURM uses the ``%A`` and ``%a`` replacement strings for the master job ID and task ID, respectively.

For example:

.. code-block:: shell

  #SBATCH --output=Array_test.%A_%a.out
  #SBATCH --error=Array_test.%A_%a.error

The error log is optional as both types of logs can be written to the 'output' log.

.. code-block:: shell

  #SBATCH --output=Array_test.%A_%a.log

.. warning::

    If you only use ``%A`` in the log all array tasks will try to write to a single file. 
    The performance of the run will approach zero asymptotically. Make sure to use both ``%A`` and ``%a`` in the log file name specification.

**Grouping tasks for efficiency**

**Limiting number of concurrent tasks**

A maximum number of simultaneously running tasks from the job array may be specified using a ``%`` separator. 
For example ``--array=0-15%4`` will limit the number of simultaneously running tasks from this job array to 4.

.. _dependent_jobs_bessemer:

.. _dependent_jobs_stanage:

Dependent jobs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Dependent jobs, or jobs submitted with dependencies on other jobs will wait until 
the job they are dependent on has met with a certain conditon. This can allow you 
to build workflows with pre-processing or post-processing steps.

Job dependencies with the SLURM scheduler on Bessemer and Stanage are 
specified with the ``--dependency`` option to ``sbatch`` using job IDs only in the format:

.. code-block:: console

  $ sbatch --dependency=<type:job_id[:job_id][,type:job_id[:job_id]]> ...

The different dependency types available are:

.. code-block:: shell

  after:jobid[:jobid...] 	#job can begin after the specified jobs have started
  afterany:jobid[:jobid...] 	#job can begin after the specified jobs have terminated
  afternotok:jobid[:jobid...] 	#job can begin after the specified jobs have failed
  afterok:jobid[:jobid...] 	#job can begin after the specified jobs have run to completion with an exit code of zero (see the user guide for caveats).
  singleton 	                #jobs can begin execution after all previously launched jobs with the same name and user have ended. This is useful to collate results of a swarm or to send a notification at the end of a swarm.

The most simple way to use dependencies are to use the **afterany** type for single consecutive jobs e.g. :

.. code-block:: console

  $ sbatch job1.sh
  Submitted batch job 12345678
  $ sbatch --dependency=afterany:12345678 job2.sh

In this case when job 1 finishes (terminates), job 2 will become eligible for scheduling. This means even if 
job 1 fails, job 2 will run.

A further example with more complicated conditions is shown below:

.. code-block:: shell

  #! /bin/bash

  # first job - no dependencies
  cmd1=$(sbatch --parsable --mem=12g --cpus-per-task=4 job1.sh)
  jid1=$( $cmd1 | cut -d ";" -f 1)

  # multiple jobs can depend on a single job
  cmd2=$(sbatch --parsable --dependency=afterany:$jid1 --mem=20g job2.sh)
  jid2=$( $cmd2 | cut -d ";" -f 1)

  cmd3=$(sbatch --parsable  --dependency=afterany:$jid1 --mem=20g job3.sh)
  jid3=$( $cmd3 | cut -d ";" -f 1)


  # a single job can depend on multiple jobs
  cmd4=$(sbatch --parsable  --dependency=afterany:$jid2:$jid3 job4.sh)
  jid4=$( $cmd4 | cut -d ";" -f 1)


  # a single job can depend on all jobs by the same user with the same name
  cmd5=$(sbatch --parsable --dependency=afterany:$jid4 --job-name=dtest job5.sh)
  jid5=$( $cmd5 | cut -d ";" -f 1)

  cmd6=$(sbatch --parsable --dependency=afterany:$jid5 --job-name=dtest job6.sh)
  jid6=$( $cmd6 | cut -d ";" -f 1)


  sbatch --dependency=singleton --job-name=dtest job9.sh

.. _timed_jobs_bessemer:

.. _timed_jobs_stanage:

Timed start jobs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Jobs can be submitted to the schedulers to run at a specific time. This section explains how 
to achieve this with SLURM on Bessemer and Stanage.

Timed start jobs using the Slurm scheduler are requested with the ``--begin`` argument in the following formats:

.. code-block:: shell

  sbatch --begin=16:00 job.sh
  sbatch --begin=now+60 job.sh #(seconds by default)
  sbatch --begin=now+1hour job.sh
  sbatch --begin=2023-06-30T12:34:00 job.sh

The scheduler will immediately submit these jobs but will wait until the elected date/time has passed before starting them.

-----

.. _preemptable_jobs_bessemer:

.. _preemptable_jobs_stanage:

Preemptable jobs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A preemptable job is a job which has been set to run in a reserved queue's node when those nodes are idle.

The reserved queues are typically private (researcher, research group-owned or dept-owned) nodes :ref:`on Bessemer <groupnodes_bessemer>`.

Usage of preemptable jobs will typically allow users to access significant amounts of resource very quickly due to poor  
utilisation of private nodes by their owners, however these resources will be instantly reclaimed (and the associated jobs preempted) 
if private node owners submit jobs that can only start immediately using their private node resources.

Usage of preemptable jobs will typically allow users to access significant amounts of compute resource very quickly due to poor private node 
utilisation of private nodes by their owners.

.. warning::

  If your job is preempted by a job from the owner of the reserved queue your job will be terminated so your jobs must be tolerant 
  to being able to stop quickly and cleanly or they will be terminated uncleanly and you can lose output data.

  i.e. your job must be able to make use of checkpointing and / or receive, understand and act on the scheduler signalling to stop execution. 

Under certain conditions,
SLURM on Bessemer and Stanage allows jobs running in higher-priority Partitions (sets of nodes) to
*preempt* jobs in lower-priority Partitions.
When a higher priority job *preempts* a lower priority job,
the lower priority job is stopped (and by default cancelled) and
the higher priority job takes its place.

Specifically, SLURM allows users to run interactive sessions and batch jobs using idle resources
in :ref:`private (research group-owned or dept-owned) nodes <groupnodes_bessemer>`,
but these resources will be reclaimed (and the associated jobs preempted) if
members of those groups/departments submit jobs that can only start if those resources are repurposed.

.. note::
    Support for preemptable jobs has been enabled on Bessemer **only**, on a trial basis
    and will be disabled if it impacts on
    priority access by groups / departments to
    private nodes they have purchased.

An example of the use of preemptable jobs:

1. Researcher A wants to run a job using 2 GPUs.  All 'public' GPUs are being used by jobs, but some GPUs in a private node belonging to research group X are idle.
2. Researcher A decides that they want to use those idle GPUs but they aren't a member of research group X; however, they are happy to take the risk of their job being preempted by a member of research group X.
3. Researcher A submits a job and makes it preemptable (by adding submitting it to the ``preempt`` Partition using ``--partition=preempt``).
4. The job starts running on a node which is a member of the ``preempt`` and ``research-group-X`` Partitions.
5. Researcher B is a member of research group X and submits a job to the ``research-group-X`` Partition.  
6. This job can only start if the resources being used by the first job are reclaimed.
7. As a result, SLURM preempts the first job with this second job, as a result of which the first job is cancelled.
8. The second job runs to completion.

.. tip::

  Tips for using preemptable jobs:

  * Ensure that you're able to reliably re-submit your preemptable job if it is preempted before completion.  A common way of doing this is to write out state/progress information periodically whilst the job is running.
  * Select a sensible frequency for writing out state/progress information or you may cause poor performance due to storage write speed limits.
