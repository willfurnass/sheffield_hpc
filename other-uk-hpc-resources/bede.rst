Bede (Tier 2 GPU cluster)
=========================

Bede is a `EPSRC-funded <https://gow.epsrc.ukri.org/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/T022167/1>`__ 'Tier 2' (regional) GPU-equipped HPC cluster.  
The system is available for use by researchers from `N8 Research Partnership`_ institutions
(Durham, Lancaster, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle, Sheffield and York).

NB the system was previously known as NICE-19.

Suitable workflows
------------------

This system is particularly well suited to supporting:
 
* **Jobs that benefit from distributing work between  multiple GPUs and possibly multiple nodes**.
* **Jobs that require much movement of data between CPU and GPU memory**.
* In particular **deep learning and machine learning workflows** that meet either of the above criteria.

Status
------

Academics/researchers can apply for access to the system (see `Further Information`_)
but note that some aspects of the system plus the registration and support mechanisms are still being refined.

Noteworthy features of the system
---------------------------------

* 32x GPU nodes (`IBM AC922`_ nodes) each with 

  * 2x IBM POWER9_ CPUs 
  * 2x `NVIDIA V100`_ GPUs per CPU
  * Each CPU is connected to its two GPUs via high-bandwidth (150GB/s), low-latency interconnects (NVLink), which helps if you need to move lots of data to/from GPU memory
  * 512 GB RAM

* 4x 'inference' nodes (`IBM IC922`_ nodes) each with

  * 2x IBM POWER9_ CPUs 
  * 4x `NVIDIA T4`_ GPUs
  * 256 GB RAM

* 6x `NVIDIA Grace Hopper Superchip (GH200 480GB)`_ nodes each with

  * 1x `NVIDIA Grace CPU`_ (72 Arm Neoverse V2 cores)
  * 1x `NVIDIA H100`_ 96GB GPU
  * The CPU and GPU are connected via 900 GB/s NVLink-C2C interconnect, which helps if you need to move lots of data to/from GPU memory or over-subscribe the GPU
  * 480 GB LPDDR5X RAM

* High-bandwidth, low-latency networking between nodes (100 Gb/s EDR Infiniband)
* High-performance parallel file system (Lustre)
* Slurm job scheduler
