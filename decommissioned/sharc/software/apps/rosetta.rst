Rosetta is a comprehensive software suite for modeling macromolecular structures. As a flexible, multi-purpose application, it includes tools for structure prediction, design, and remodeling of proteins and nucleic acids. Since 1998, Rosetta web servers have run billions of structure prediction and protein design simulations, and billions or trillions more have been run on supercomputer clusters.

Usage
-----

Rosetta can be activated by loading one of the following module files: ::

    module load apps/rosetta/3.13/binary
    module load apps/rosetta/3.10/binary
    module load apps/rosetta/3.8/binary

The above module file adds the Rosetta executables to a user's path.

Installation notes
------------------

Rosetta 3.8 was installed using the
:download:`install_rosetta.sh </decommissioned/sharc/software/install_scripts/apps/rosetta/3.8/binary/install_rosetta.sh>` script; the module
file is
:download:`/usr/local/modulefiles/apps/rosetta/3.8/binary </decommissioned/sharc/software/modulefiles/apps/rosetta/3.8/binary>`.
The installation of Rosetta 3.8 was a binary installation.
