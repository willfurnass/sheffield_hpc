Jupyter on SHARC: preparing your environment
============================================

.. toc:

Background
----------

Once you have a Jupyter Notebook server running
(e.g. on a cluster worker node)
you typically want to consider your **execution environment**,
which is your choice of

* **Kernel** (code cell language)
* **software packages/libraries**

Kernels
^^^^^^^

Jupyter Notebooks were originally known as *IPython* Notebooks
but now Jupyter supports Notebook code cells written in `many different languages <https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels>`__.
This is achieved by the (per-user) Jupyter Notebook server
sending the contents of code cells to a **Kernel** for evaluation.
The most widely used Kernels are:

* the `IPython Kernel`_,
  the default Kernel,
  which can run code cells containing Python >= 3.3 and Python 2.7;
* IRKernel_, a Kernel for R_ >= 3.2.

Packages
^^^^^^^^

Most notebooks make use of external software packages for e.g. fitting statistical models to data.
There are several different ways you might enable/load packages on ShARC
(including :ref:`module files <env_modules>` and :ref:`Apptainer containers <apptainer_sharc>`)
but if using Jupyter it is recommended that you install and activate software using
the conda_ package manager if possible.
This can be done using Jupyter's graphical interface (in most cases)
or from the command-line.

Environments
^^^^^^^^^^^^

conda_ packages are installed into **environments**.
An environment is an isolated collection of packages.
You might create:

* One environment for one project containing Python 3, the IPython Kernel and the ``pandas`` and ``matplotlib`` Python packages (plus dependencies) for data analysis.
* Another environment for a second project containing R, the IRKernel and the ``dplyr`` and ``gplot2`` R packages.
* A third environment containing Python 2.7 plus ``pandas`` but no Kernel for work that doesn't involve Jupyter Notebooks.

conda_ allows users to

* Install and manage packages without a system adminstrator needing to be involved;
* Isolate and audit the set of packages used per project (good for reproducible research)
* Share environment definitions with others and with automated test/build systems (i.e. `continuous integration`_)

Using conda on ShARC via Jupyter
--------------------------------

At this time, Conda environments on ShARC can only be inspected, created and modified from the command-line,
not directly using JupyterLab's interface.
However, we can use a :ref:`JupyterLab-provided Terminal <jh_terminal>` to give us a command-line environment,
so we don't need to leave JupyterHub/JupyterLab for this.

Creating a new conda environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before we run a Notebook we typically want to
create a new conda_ **environment** containing
the packages we are interested in
plus a Jupyter Kernel.

See the general documentation for :ref:`using conda on ShARC <sharc-python-conda>` for
generic instructions on how to create conda environments from the command-line.
Note that if you are using a :ref:`JupyterLab Terminal <jh_terminal>`
then you do not need to load conda using ``module load ...``.
Make sure you **install a package containing a Jupyter Kernel** (e.g. ``ipykernel`` for Python work or ``r-ipykernel`` for R work) into your environment.

When following that documentation you might want to use the following as starting points for creating Jupyter(Hub)-compatible environments:

Python 3:

.. code-block:: sh

   conda create -n example-python-env python=3.10 ipykernel

R:

.. code-block:: sh

   conda create -n example-r-env r-irkernel jupyter_client libiconv

Python from the `Intel Python Distribution <https://software.intel.com/en-us/distribution-for-python>`__:

.. code-block:: sh

   conda create -n example-intel-python-env -c intel intelpython3_core
   ipykernel jupyter_client

.. note::
   If you want to create one or more large Conda environments then
   there is a risk this will fill up your 10GB home directory.

   You may want to explicitly tell Conda to
   :ref:`create environments in a location with a larger quota <sharc_conda_data_dir>`.

Capturing the state of an environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is important to track the versions of packages you used to generate your research outputs,
primarily to allow you and others to easily repeat your workflows.
Ideally you should manage a file detailing the packages in your environment,
plus your Notebook and other project files,
in a version control system such as `git <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git>`__.

After creating/modifying an environment:

* Click on the export icon (left-most icon beneath **Action**) for a given environment
  to download a conda environment definition file.
* Alternatively you can generate a definition file
  from a :ref:`JupyterLab Terminal <jh_terminal>`: ::

    source activate my-env-name
    cd /data/$USER/research-project-7
    conda env export > environment.yml

   Modifying an environment
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   **TODO**
   * NB some are read-only

.. commented out the following notes until nb_conda has had more testing
   Managing (Conda) environments
   -----------------------------
   WHAT CAN YOU DO
   WHY WANT TO DO IT
   * DISCOURAGED FROM USING ANACONDA ENVS
   * SHOULD NOT USE JUPYTER ENVS
   * The **anaconda** environments have been installed by a system administrator and cannot be changed.
   * They give you access to a large number of Python packages commonly used by data scientists.
   * The **jupyterhub** environments are for administrative purposes and should never be used.

you can start :ref:`creating, editing and running Jupyter Notebooks <jh_nb_usage>`.
