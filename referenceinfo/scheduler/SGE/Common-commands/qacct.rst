By default the ``qacct`` command will only bring up summary info about the user's jobs from the 
current accounting file (which rotates monthly). By using the ``-f AcctFilePath`` flag and the 
accounting file path of interest, previous months usage can be quantified e.g. : ::

    qacct -u $USER -f $SGE_ROOT/default/common/accounting-archive/accounting-20210101

By using bash ``xargs`` and ``find`` you can also parse multiple files to list jobs as follows: ::

    find $SGE_ROOT/default/common/accounting-archive/ -mtime -90 -type f | xargs -t -n1 qacct -j -u $USER -f

This command is instructing the linux ``find`` executable to look for files younger than 90 days and 
then ``xargs`` passes the accounting files it finds to the qacct command (in bold.)

Like previous ``qacct`` commands the ``-j`` flag can once again take a job ID to pull up a specific 
job's details.
