GPU Computing
=============

Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) were, as the name suggests, originally designed for the efficient processing of graphics. Over time, they were developed into systems that were capable of performing general purpose computing which is why some people refer to modern GPUs as GP-GPUs (General Purpose Graphical Processing Units).

Graphics processing tpically involves relatively simple computations that need to applied to millions of on-screen pixels in parallel. As such, GPUs tend to be very quick and efficient at computing certain types of parallel workloads.

The `GPUComputing@Sheffield website
<http://gpucomputing.sites.sheffield.ac.uk/>`_ aims to facilitate the use of GPU computing within University of Sheffield research by providing resources for training and purchasing of equipment as well as providing a network of GPU users and research projects within the University.
