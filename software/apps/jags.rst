JAGS is Just Another Gibbs Sampler.  It is a program for analysis of Bayesian hierarchical models using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation not wholly unlike BUGS.  JAGS was written with three aims in mind:

* To have a cross-platform engine for the BUGS language
* To be extensible, allowing users to write their own functions, distributions and samplers.
* To be a plaftorm for experimentation with ideas in Bayesian modelling

Interactive Usage
-----------------
After connecting to iceberg (see :ref:`ssh`),  start an interactive sesssion with the :code:`qsh` or :code:`qrsh` command. To make JAGS available in this session, run one of the following module command

.. code-block:: none

      module load apps/gcc/4.8.3/JAGS/3.1
      module load apps/gcc/4.8.2/JAGS/3.4

You can now run the ``jags`` command ::

        jags

The rjags and runjags interfaces in R
-------------------------------------
`rjags <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rjags/index.html>`_ and `runjags <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/runjags/index.html>`_ are CRAN packages that provide an R interface to jags. They are not installed in R by default.

After connecting to iceberg (see :ref:`ssh`), start an interactive sesssion with the :code:`qrsh` command. Run the following module commands ::

        module load compilers/gcc/4.8.2
        module load apps/gcc/4.8.2/JAGS/3.4
        module load apps/R/3.2

Launch R by typing ``R`` and pressing return. Within R, execute the following commands ::

        install.packages('rjags')
        install.packages('runjags')

and follow the on-screen inctructions. Answer ``y`` to any questions about the creation of a personal library should they be asked.

The packages will be stored in a directory called `R` within your home directory.

You should only need to run the ``install.packages`` commands once. When you log into the system in future, you will only need to run the ``module`` commands above to make JAGS available to the system.

You load the rjags packages the same as you would any other R package ::

        library('rjags')
        library('runjags')

If you received an error message such as ::

    Error : .onLoad failed in loadNamespace() for 'rjags', details:
      call: dyn.load(file, DLLpath = DLLpath, ...)
      error: unable to load shared object '/home/fe1mpc/R/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-library/3.2/rjags/libs/rjags.so':
      libjags.so.3: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
    Error: package or namespace load failed for 'rjags'

the most likely cause is that you forget to load the necessary modules before starting R.
