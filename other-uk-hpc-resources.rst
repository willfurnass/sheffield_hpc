*****************************************
Access to External UK HPC Facilities
*****************************************

The United Kingdom has a number of HPC facilities external to the University of Sheffield 
which will grant researchers HPC resources. These include National facilities (Tier 1) such 
as Archer 2 and regional systems (Tier 2) such as :ref:`JADE2 <JADE2>` and :ref:`BEDE <bede>`.

The University of Sheffield is a member of the :ref:`JADE2 <JADE2>` and :ref:`BEDE <bede>` regional systems thus 
registration for using resources on these systems is straightforward with dedicated pages 
describing these systems and their application processes listed below.

Further Tier 1 and Tier 2 systems are also listed below with a brief explanation of their 
purpose along with links for further details.

`ARCHER2 <https://www.archer2.ac.uk/>`_, the new UK national supercomputing service 
offers a capability resource for running very large parallel jobs. Based around an HPE 
Cray EX supercomputing system with an estimated peak performance of 28 PFLOP/s, the 
machine will have 5,848 compute nodes, each with dual AMD EPYC Zen2 (Rome) 64 core CPUs 
at 2.2GHz, giving 748,544 cores in total. The initial service, which will be live from 
early 2021, is based on a subset of 4 cabinets of the total 23 cabinet system. The 
remaining 19 cabinets will be added later in 2021. The service includes a service 
desk staffed by HPC experts from EPCC with support from HPE Cray. Access is free at 
point of use for academic researchers working in the EPSRC and NERC domains. Users 
will also be able to purchase access at a variety of rates.

`Cambridge Service for Data Driven Discovery (CSD3) <https://www.csd3.cam.ac.uk/>`_ is 
one of the EPSRC Tier-2 HPC facilities. CSD3 is a multi-institution service 
underpinned by an innovative, petascale, data-centric HPC platform, designed 
specifically to drive data-intensive simulation and high-performance data analysis. 
Free access is available to academic researchers working in the EPSRC domain and from 
some UK universities; academic users from other domains and institutions can purchase 
access.

`Sulis at HPC Midlands+ <https://sulis.ac.uk/>`_ is a 
Tier-2 HPC platform for ensemble computing workflows, realised through replicating 
workstation-scale calculations over many inputs or models. Sulis delivers substantial 
HPC capacity targeted at data-intensive, high-throughput workloads, based on modern 
software deployment and containerisation technologies to enable scale up from workstation 
to Tier-2 with minimal code modification. The platform is further supported by a developing 
Research Software Engineering training effort which recognises non-traditional routes to 
large-scale scientific research. Access to Sulis is available through the EPSRC Access to 
HPC calls or via the HPC Midlands+ Consortium.
