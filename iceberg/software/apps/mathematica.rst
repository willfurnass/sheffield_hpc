   :Latest version: 10.3.1

Mathematica is a technical computing environment and programming language with strong symbolic and numerical abilities.

Single Core Interactive Usage
-----------------------------
After connecting to iceberg (see :ref:`ssh`),  start an interactive session with ``qsh``.

The latest version of Mathematica can be loaded with ::

        module load apps/binapps/mathematica

Alternatively, you can load a specific version of Mathematica using ::

        module load apps/binapps/mathematica/10.3.1
        module load apps/binapps/mathematica/10.2

Mathematica can then be started with the ``mathematica`` command ::

        mathematica

Multicore Interactive Usage
---------------------------
Mathematica has extensive parallel functionality. To use it, you should request a parallel interactive session. For example, to request 4 cores ::

    qsh -pe openmp 4

Load and launch Mathematica ::

    module load apps/binapps/mathematica
    mathematica

In Mathematica, let's time how long it takes to calculate the first 20 million primes on 1 CPU core ::

    AbsoluteTiming[primelist = Table[Prime[k], {k, 1, 20000000}];]

When I tried this, I got 78 seconds. Your results may vary greatly. Now, let's launch 4 ParallelKernels and redo the calculation in parallel ::

    LaunchKernels[4]
    AbsoluteTiming[primelist =
   ParallelTable[Prime[k], {k, 1, 20000000},
    Method -> "CoarsestGrained"];]

When I tried this, I got 29 seconds -- around 2.7 times faster. This illustrates a couple of points:-

* You should always request the same number of kernels as you requested in your ``qsh`` command (in this case, 4). If you request more, you will damage performance for yourself and other users of the system.
* N kernels doesn't always translate to N times faster.

Batch Submission
----------------
Unfortunately, it is not possible to run Mathematica notebook .nb files directly in batch.  Instead, you need to create a simple text file that contains all of the Mathematica commands you want to execute.  Typically, such files are given the extension .m.  Let’s run the following simple Mathematica script as a batch job. ::

  (*Find out what version of Mathematica this machine is running*)
  Print["Mathematica version is " <> $Version]

  (*Find out the name of the machine we are running on*)
  Print["The machine name is " <> $MachineName]

  (*Do a calculation*)
  Print["The result of the integral is "]
  Print [ Integrate[Sin[x]^2, x]]

Copy and paste the above into a text file called `very_simple_mathematica.m`

An example batch submission script for this file is ::

  #!/bin/bash
  # Request 4 gigabytes of real memory (mem)
  # and 4 gigabytes of virtual memory (mem)
  #$ -l mem=4G -l rmem=4G

  module load apps/binapps/mathematica/10.3.1

  math -script very_simple_mathematica.m

Copy and paste the above into a file called `run_job.sh` and submit with ::

  qsub run_job.sh

Once the job has successfully completed, the output will be in a file named like `run_job.sh.o396699`. The number at the end refers to the job-ID given to this job by the system and will be different for you. Let's take a look at the contents of this file ::

  more run_job.sh.o396699

  Mathematica version is 10.2.0 for Linux x86 (64-bit) (July 28, 2015)
  The machine name is node131
  The result of the integral is
  x/2 - Sin[2*x]/4
