Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

Usage
-----
An old version of git is installed as part of the system's opertaing system. As such, it is available everywhere, including on the log-in nodes  ::

    $ git --version
    git version 1.7.1

This was released in April 2010. We recommend that you load the most up to date version using modules - something that can only be done after starting an interactive ``qrsh`` or ``qsh`` session ::

    module load apps/gcc/5.2/git/2.5
