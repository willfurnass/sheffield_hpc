Hardware-accelerated graphics rendering
=======================================

Software that requires OpenGL and a graphics card to render complex visualisations cannot be run on all of Iceberg's nodes as:

* Only a limited number of nodes have graphics cards
* None of the nodes that do have a monitor attached

To run such software on Iceberg we therefore need:

* A means to automate the finding of a node with a graphics card that we can use for visualisation purposes
* A way of streaming the images rendered on a node through to the machine the user is sat in front of.

We have set up on Iceberg a system for hardware-accelerated visualisation that uses two main tools: VirtualGL and TigerVNC.  See below for simple usage instructions.

Usage instructions
------------------

#. Download and install `TigerVNC <http://sourceforge.net/projects/tigervnc/>`_ on your machine.  TigerVNC is a program that allows you to efficiently view graphical programs on one computer that are actually running on another computer.
#. :ref:`Connect to Iceberg <getting-started>`
#. On the login node (**not** a worker node) run the command ``qsh-vis``.  The output should look something like the following: ::

    [te1st@iceberg-login1 ~]$ qsh-vis 

    NOTE: you can only run 1 GPU acclerated session


    New 'node000:1 (te1st)' desktop is node000:1

    Starting applications specified in /home/te1st/.vnc/xstartup
    Log file is /home/te1st/.vnc/node000:1.log


    Accelerated VNC graphics session started

    *******To connect: *******

    Either startup a web-browser and enter the address:
    http://iceberg-gateway.shef.ac.uk:5801

                  or 

    use the TigerVNC application to connect to:
    iceberg-gateway.shef.ac.uk:5901

    Make sure to enter your normal Iceberg username/password when prompted.

    To end session : press [enter]

#. Leave that terminal running.
#. On your machine start the 'VNC Viewer' program that comes with TigerVNC (this is called ``vncviewer`` on Linux).  You should then see a dialog box like this:

    .. image:: /images/vncviewer_dialog.png

#. Enter the connection details for TigerVNC that were issued by the ``qsh-vis`` command e.g. ``iceberg-gateway.shef.ac.uk:5901`` (NB the last four digits may differ when you run ``qsh-vis``).
#. Click *Connect*
#. You should now see a desktop within a window.  This desktop is running on a worker node (in the case of the presented example this is ``node000```; see the ``qsh-vis`` output) that is equipped with a graphics card (Optional: run ``nvidia-smi`` to see what type of graphics card).  A terminal window is automatically started from which you can :ref:`load modules <modules_usage>` and start applications that require hardware-accelerated graphics.

    .. image:: /images/vncviewer_session.png

#. When you are finished, close VNC Viewer then return to the terminal within which you started ``qsh-vis`` and press enter to stop the worker session (and allow someone else to use that graphics-card-equipped node).

Resources available to qsh-vis sessions
---------------------------------------

* Sessions started using ``qsh-vis`` by default have allocated to them:

    * 1 CPU core
    * 1 GPU
    * 12GB of virtual memory 

* You can request additional resources by passing the same parameters to ``qsh-vis`` that can be used with ``qrsh``/``qrshx``/``qsh``/``qsub`` (see :ref:`sge-queue`).
* Research groups who have purchased their own GPU visualisation nodes may have different defaults.

Availability
------------

At present only **one** graphics-card-equipped node is available for use with ``qsh-vis`` so there may be contention for this resource.  Some research groups have purchased their own visualisation nodes.

Technical details
-----------------

Behind the scenes: 

* ``qsh-vis`` sets the default resources to be requested for the interactive session (based on whether the user belongs to a research group that has dedicated visualisation nodes)...
* ...then uses ``qrsh`` to start a script with these resources.
* This script then starts a TigerVNC ``vncserver`` on a port that is unique over the range of machines on which hardware-accelerated visualisation sessions can be started.
* TigerVNC supports `VirtualGL <http://www.virtualgl.org/About/Introduction>`_, a means of streaming the images rendered by say a graphics card to a remote machine.
* The aforementioned script then kills the created ``Xvnc`` process when Enter is pressed.
